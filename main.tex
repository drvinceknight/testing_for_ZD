\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    The Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is a model for rational and evolutionary
    interactive behaviour. It has applications both in the study of human social
    behaviour as well as in biology.

    This game is used to understand when and how a rational individual might
    accept an immediate cost to their own utility for the direct benefit of
    another.

    Much attention has been given to a class of strategies for this game, called
    Zero Determinant strategies. It has been theoretically shown that these
    strategies can ``extort'' any player.

    In this work, an approach to identify if observed strategies are playing in
    a Zero Determinant way is described. Furthermore, experimental analysis of
    a large tournament with \input{assets/tex/number_of_strategies/main.tex}
    strategies is considered. In this setting
    the most highly performing strategies do not play in a Zero Determinant way.
    This suggests that whilst the theory of Zero Determinant strategies
    indicates that memory is not of fundamental importance to the evolution of
    cooperative behaviour, this is incomplete.

\section{Recognising Extortion}\label{sec:delta-zd-strategies}


In~\cite{Press2012}, given a match between 2 memory-one strategies, the
concept of Zeto-Determinant (ZD) strategies is introduced. The main result of
that paper showed that given two players \(p, q\in\mathbb{R}^2\) a linear
relationship between the players scores could be forced.

Assuming the utilities for player \(p\) are given by \(S_x=(R, S, T, P)\) and
for player \(q\) by \(S_y=(R, T, S, P)\) and that the stationary scores of each
player is given by \(S_X\) and \(S_Y\) respectively. The main result
of~\cite{Press2012} is that if

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:linear_relationship_for_p}
    \tilde p=\alpha S_x + \beta S_y + \gamma
\end{equation}

or

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:linear_relationship_for_q}
    \tilde q=\alpha S_x + \beta S_y + \gamma
\end{equation}

where \(\tilde p = (1 - p_1, 1 - p_2, p_3, p_4)\) and
\(\tilde q = (1 - q_1, 1 - q_2, q_3, q_4)\) then:

\begin{equation}
    \alpha S_X + \beta S_Y + \gamma = 0
\end{equation}

This work is interested with identifying a test for the reverse problem: given a
\(p\in\mathbb{R}^4\) how does one identify \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\) if they
exist.

Note that equation~\ref{eqn:linear_relationship_for_p} can be expressed linear
algebraically as:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:linear_algebraic_equation_for_p}
    Mx=\tilde p  \qquad x=(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)
\end{equation}

with \(M\in\mathbb{R}^{4\times 3}\) given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:definition_of_M}
    M =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        R & R & 1\\
        S & T & 1\\
        T & S & 1\\
        P & P & 1
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

% TODO What is the rank of M? Can we prove something about it?

Note that in general, equation (\ref{eqn:linear_algebraic_equation_for_p}) will
not necessarily have a solution. From the RouchÃ©-Capelli theorem~\cite{}% TODO
if there is a solution it is unique as \(\text{rank}(M)=3\) which the dimension of
the variable \(x\)). Furthermore, removing a single row of \(M\) would
ensure that the corresponding matrix is invertible. This corresponds to the fact
that a ZD strategy is defined by only 3 of its values.

As an example, consider the known ZD strategy \(p=(8 / 9, 1 / 2, 1 / 3, 0)\)
from~\cite{Stewart2012} which is referred to as \texttt{Extort-2}. In the
standard case of \((R, S, T, P)=(3, 0, 5, 1)\) the inverse
of \(M_{(4)}\) (removing the last row of \(M\)) is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inverse_of_M4}
    M_{(4)}^{-1} =
    \input{./assets/tex/inverse_of_M4/main.tex}
\end{equation}

This allows us to find the \(x=(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)\) corresponding to
\(\tilde p\):

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:alpha_beta_gamma_for_extort_2}
    x = M_{(4)}^{-1}\tilde p_{(4)} =
    \input{./assets/tex/alpha_beta_gamma_for_extort_2/main.tex}
\end{equation}

Using (\ref{eqn:linear_algebraic_equation_for_p}) gives that these values lead
to the correct value for \(p_4=0\) confirm that \(p_4\) is a ZD strategy.

This approach could in fact be used to confirm that a given strategy \(p\)
represents is ZD. However, in practice, if a closed form for \(p\) is not
known, then due to measurement and/or numerical error this would not work.

Thus, an approach based on least squares~\cite{Golub2013} is proposed. This
approach finds the best fitting \(\bar x=(\bar\alpha, \bar\beta,
\bar\gamma)\) which minimises:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:r_squared}
R^2 = \|M x-\tilde p\|_2 = \sum_{i=1}^{4}\left((M\bar x)_i-\tilde p_i\right)^2
\end{equation}

Note that \(R^2\) which is the square of the Frobenius norm~\cite{Golub2013}
becomes a measure of how close \(p\) is to being a ZD strategy.

As an example, Figure~\ref{fig:R_squared_for_varying_p2_for_extort2} shows
\(R^2\) for the vector \(p=(8/9, p_2, 1/3, 0)\) for varying value of \(p_2\). As
expected, the lowest value is obtained for \(p_2=1/2\).

\begin{figure}[!htbp]
    \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=.6\textwidth]{assets/img/R_squared_for_varying_p2_for_extort2/main.pdf}
    \caption{\(R^2\) as defined in (\ref{eqn:r_squared}) for \(p=(8/9, p_2, 1/3,
    0)\).}
    \label{fig:R_squared_for_varying_p2_for_extort2}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

In~\cite{Press2012} a particular type of ZD is defined, if:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:constraint_for_extortion}
    P(\alpha + \beta)+\gamma=0
\end{equation}

then the player can ensure they get a score at \(\chi\) times
better than the opponent with. This extortion coefficient is given by:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:definition_of_chi}
    \chi=\frac{-\beta}{\alpha} 
\end{equation}

Thus, if (\ref{eqn:constraint_for_extortion}) holds and \(\chi >1\) a player is
said to extort their opponent. Recalling (\ref{eqn:definition_of_M}), equation
(\ref{eqn:constraint_for_extortion}) corresponds to the last row of \(M\), thus
a player \(p\) extorts their opponent if and only if it is ZD and \(\chi > 1\).
Using the method of least squares, the strategy \(p\) is ZD for a given
threshold of \(R^2\) and \(\chi\) can be approximated.
Figure~\ref{fig:examples_of_extortion} illustrates this for four potential
strategies: for all of these we see that for the strategy to be extortionate: as
\(p_2\) increases \(p_3\) also increases (seemingly linearly).

    \(p=(p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4)\). The solid line shows the values for which \(R^2
    < 10 ^ {-6}\). Only values for which \(\chi > 1\) are displayed, strategies
    outside of that region cannot be extortionate.}
