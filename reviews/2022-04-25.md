# Handling Editor:

Your paper has been reviewed by two reviewers. Their
evaluations are mixed; while reviewer #2 positively evaluates the paper,
reviewer #1 raises a number of concerns. I share most of them. In particular, I
feel that the Sections 2 and 3 are not integrated well (comment 1 by rev#1) and
that the comparison with previous literature that discussed ZD-(like) strategies
in the context of evolution is no sufficient (comments 2,5,6 by rev#1). I agree
with the referees that the new measure, SSE, is interesting, but this itself is
not sufficient for publication. The "contradiction" that reviewer #1 finds
between Sections 2 and 3 must be resolved fundamentally. A substantial revision
is needed. Please note that our interim decision does not guarantee the
acceptance of the paper after revision.


# Reviewer #1:

Extortionate strategies, which are one of the subclass strategies
of ZD, were defined in the seminal work by Press and Dyson. In this manuscript,
they used such extortionate strategies as a benchmark. First, the authors
developed SSE. This measurement indicates how a strategy is far from
extortionate strategies. In the rigorous definition of extortion, we have to
know the exact p1, p2, p3, and p4 values in memory-one strategies. Instead, the
authors infer those values from the actual history of gameplay between the two
players, and then compared the values with the values calculated from Eqns.
7-10. Finally, SSE is obtained. This idea is interesting in the sense that even
if a strategy is not memory-one, the likeness of extortion is defined, as the
authors mentioned. I like the approach. However, it seems that the manuscript is
immature in many senses. I raise the immature points below. Unless these issues
are correctly addressed, I do not recommend the publication of this manuscript
in JTB.

1. What is the role of Sec. 3 (Evolutionary dynamics)? In that section, the
   authors showed that strategies that have a negative skew of SSE such as
   EvolvedLookerUp2_2_2 are evolutionary favored because such strategies can
   establish mutual cooperation with strong opponents while can extort against
   to weak opponents. On the other hand, the authors also showed that pure
   extortionate strategies such as ZD-Extort-2 which have zero mean SSE and a
   positive skew of SSE is not favored by evolution. In the first part of the
   manuscript (Sec. 2), the authors mainly focused on the effectiveness of
   extortion (how it is defined from the history of gameplay and how it is
   strong). But in Sec. 3, the authors revealed the ineffectiveness of
   extortion. Thus, I felt the contradiction between the former and the latter
   parts in the manuscript.

2. It is already known that extortion is very strong in one to one interaction
   but is very weak in an evolving population [Hilbe et al., Nat. Hum. Behav. 2,
   469-477 (2018)]. On the other hand, generous ZD strategies [Stewart &
   Plotkin, PNAS, 110, 15348-15353 (2013)], which are very weak in one to one
   interaction but are very strong in an evolving population, have attracted
   great attention in the literature. Thus, the analysis of generous ZD
   strategies should be included in this manuscript. How is the SSE of generous
   ZD and is that a negative skew or positive skew?

3. The mathematical notations are quite immature. For example, p, q, \tilde{p},
   \tilde{q}, S_x, S_y should be bold because they are vector. The payoff matrix
   of PD in the Introduction and the replicator dynamics described as Eq. (25)
   are boorish because each variable is not explained anywhere. "the utilities
   for player p" should be "the utilities for player X" and the same for player
   Y.

4. Graphs are rough. For example, the font sizes of for labels in Fig. 3 are too
   small. Figure 4 is also rough. What is the strategy with the highest
   stationary distribution as the result of evolution? Should be described in
   the figure or in the main text.

5. The description of Sec. 3 is rough. In the current manuscript, only the
   simple analysis and the results are provided. There is no motivation why
   evolutionary dynamics is needed to be considered. At the beginning of Sec. 3,
   such motivation should be carefully explained.

6. It seems that  [Hilbe et al., Nat. Hum. Behav. 2, 469-477 (2018)] can provide
   a good motivation to this study but it is not cited. It should be cited in
   the Introduction.

7. The organization of this paper is immature. I read many papers published in
   JTB, but it is first time to read the Abstract is divided into some parts.
   The length of the Abstract is long and one paragraph is enough. It seems that
   the second paragraph sounds not so important to me. Also, the sections are
   not usual. In the standard framework, the sections should be Introduction,
   Model (or Methods), Results, and Discussion. The manuscript is not along with
   the rule at all. It should be improved.


# Reviewer #2:

This work claims that the definition of zd strategies is rigid. So
the authors design a method to detect the extortion strategy leveraging the
historical game data and do the statistic. This is like a inverse to the
existing zd like strategies. Authors also did the tournament of many strategies
and run this detection method to find the extorioners. It is a good paper with
clear presentation, interesing (although limited) idea and concrete simulation.

1. The paper essentially discussed about designing a method that approximating a
   linear system based on the data. I'm more interested in whether this can be
   extended to a learning method so that agents can learn that the opponent is
   using which kind of zd strategy. It could be much stronger if the author can
   simply correlated the current result to a very basic learning scheme.

2. Based on zd strategies, more works about control the other's payoff have been
   seen. For example, [Akin 2015, "What you gotta know to play good in the
   iterated prisoners dilemma"] designed the non-linear control and this is
   further formulated by Hao et al. 2018 "Payoff Control in Iterated Prisoners'
   Dilemma". Is it possible for this paper to handle the non-linear control
   cases that proposed in these papersï¼Ÿ
