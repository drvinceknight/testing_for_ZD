We appreciate the opportunity to revise the manuscript. We are also pleased to
note that the comments from reviewer 1 seem to mainly be about the presentation
of the work and not the scientific substance which it seems that both reviewers
support. Indeed, the major point being
about the contradiction between Sections 2 and 3 identify a possibility for
improvement of the presentation of the work: we aimed to demonstrate in Section
2 that there was a body of literature that claimed that extortion is highly
effective. Section 3 is our main contribution to the literature which is to
highlight that such claims are incomplete and in fact that extortion lacks the
ability to adapt which is fundamentally important to evolution.
We believe we have improved the presentation of the contributions and will discuss the
modifications made in detail below.

Reviewer 2 made 2 main suggestions for further work, we have added to the paper
by including some new analysis.


# Reviewer #1:

Extortionate strategies, which are one of the subclass strategies
of ZD, were defined in the seminal work by Press and Dyson. In this manuscript,
they used such extortionate strategies as a benchmark. First, the authors
developed SSE. This measurement indicates how a strategy is far from
extortionate strategies. In the rigorous definition of extortion, we have to
know the exact p1, p2, p3, and p4 values in memory-one strategies. Instead, the
authors infer those values from the actual history of gameplay between the two
players, and then compared the values with the values calculated from Eqns.
7-10. Finally, SSE is obtained. This idea is interesting in the sense that even
if a strategy is not memory-one, the likeness of extortion is defined, as the
authors mentioned. I like the approach. However, it seems that the manuscript is
immature in many senses. I raise the immature points below. Unless these issues
are correctly addressed, I do not recommend the publication of this manuscript
in JTB.

   The role of Section 2 is to give an overview of the mathematical definition
   of Extortionate strategies so as to present the novel linear algebraic
   measure of the manuscript. We do not believe that we mainly focus on the
   effectiveness of extortion. Here is what is in each part of Section 2:

   - In the opening of section 2: we give the linear algebraic definition of ZD
     strategies and include sentences such as ``The main result of Press2012 is
     that given two memory-one players $p, q\in\mathbb{R}^4$, a linear
     relationship between the players' scores can, in some cases, be forced by
     one of the players for specific choices of these probabilities.''.  Note
     the use of *in some cases*. We do not believe we make any claims here as to
     the effectiveness of extortion.
   - In Section 2.1 we describe the vector space of ZD strategies. We do not
     believe we make any claims here as to the effectiveness of extortion.
   - In Section 2.2 we give the definition of the SSE measure which allows us to
     measure how far any given vector of 4 probabilities (or memory one
     strategy) is from the space of ZD strategies. We do not believe we make any
     claims here as to the effectiveness of extortion.

   To answer the question posed by the reviewer: the role of Section 3 is to
   present evidence about the **ineffectiveness** of extortion in evolutionary
   settings.

   To clarify the above we have added a sentence to the opening of both Section
   2 and Section 3 as to their role.

2. > It is already known that extortion is very strong in one to one interaction
   > but is very weak in an evolving population [Hilbe et al., Nat. Hum. Behav. 2,
   > 469-477 (2018)]. On the other hand, generous ZD strategies [Stewart &

   We have added the Hilbe et al. 2018 paper to our introduction where we
   discuss  other papers that have questioned the effectiveness of ZD
   strategies in evolving populations. Thank you for this suggestion.

   The 2013 work of Stewart and Plotkin is in the paper and it is the subject of
   Figure 1. The generous ZD strategy mentioned in their work is
   ZDGTFT2 (which is the name used in Stewart and Plotkin's paper).

   Regarding the discussion of generous ZD strategies more generally, ZDGen2 (of
   Kuhn 2017)
   and ZDGTFT2 were already present in the paper. Since this review we have
   added the ZDSet2 to the summary tables of the larger
   results and also included it in a new figure in the discussion section.

   A note has also been added about the generous ZD strategies.

3. > The mathematical notations are quite immature. For example, p, q, \tilde{p},
   > \tilde{q}, S_x, S_y should be bold because they are vector. "the utilities
   > for player p" should be "the utilities for player X" and the same for player
   > Y.

   We have made the suggested changes.

   > The payoff matrix

   > are boorish because each variable is not explained anywhere.

   We have added the classic names of the variables R,S,T,P to the PD matrix
   description and defined the population vector term in Eq 25.

4. > Graphs are rough. For example, the font sizes of for labels in Fig. 3 are too
   > small. Figure 4 is also rough. What is the strategy with the highest

   The size of Figure 3 has been increased.

   The strategies are ordered by score in Figure 4, this has been clarified and
   the name of the strategy with the highest stationary distribution has been
   added in the main text.

5. > The description of Sec. 3 is rough. In the current manuscript, only the
   > simple analysis and the results are provided. There is no motivation why
   > evolutionary dynamics is needed to be considered. At the beginning of Sec. 3,
   > such motivation should be carefully explained.

   An introductory paragraph has been added to Section 3 motivating the
   investigation of evolutionary dynamics.

6. > It seems that  [Hilbe et al., Nat. Hum. Behav. 2, 469-477 (2018)] can provide
   > a good motivation to this study but it is not cited. It should be cited in
   > the Introduction.

   This has been cited.

7. The organization of this paper is immature. I read many papers published in
   JTB, but it is first time to read the Abstract is divided into some parts.
   The length of the Abstract is long and one paragraph is enough. It seems that
   the second paragraph sounds not so important to me. Also, the sections are
   not usual. In the standard framework, the sections should be Introduction,
   Model (or Methods), Results, and Discussion. The manuscript is not along with
   the rule at all. It should be improved.

   The sections have been reorganised so as to match the requested titles: there
   is now an Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion section. The
   Replicator Dynamics section now sits under the Results section.

   The abstract has been shortened substantially.


# Reviewer #2:

This work claims that the definition of zd strategies is rigid. So
the authors design a method to detect the extortion strategy leveraging the
historical game data and do the statistic. This is like a inverse to the
existing zd like strategies. Authors also did the tournament of many strategies
and run this detection method to find the extorioners. It is a good paper with
clear presentation, interesing (although limited) idea and concrete simulation.

   This is indeed a very interesting suggestion. A numerical experiment showing
   the potential for such an approach has been added to the Discussion section
   however as mentioned in the text to do this investigation properly is outside
   of the scope of the paper. Comparing the potential to learn from the SSE
   measure to a more compressed evolved behaviour would be a fascinating piece
   of work.

2. > Based on zd strategies, more works about control the other's payoff have been

   A note has been added to the discussion section about this as a possible
   avenue for future recent but we feel this is outside of the scope of the
   current paper.
